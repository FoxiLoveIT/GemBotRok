Rise of Kingdoms Gem Bot

Overview:
Welcome to the Rise of Kingdoms Gem Bot, a pioneering project in my portfolio. This bot represents a fusion of cutting-edge technology and gaming prowess, designed specifically for enhancing the gameplay experience within the popular strategy game, Rise of Kingdoms.

Key Features:

Computer vision integration. Using the powerful openCV library, this bot is equipped with advanced computer vision capabilities. It uses image recognition algorithms to quickly detect and interact with in-game elements, allowing you to simulate player interactions with the game environment.
Custom Configuration: The bot is carefully configured to run smoothly on the main monitor with Full HD resolution and a refresh rate of 60 frames per second.
Game Compatibility: Originally designed for the English version of Rise of Kingdoms, the bot is easy to use for farming gems.

Disclaimer:
While the Rise of Kingdoms Vision Bot is designed to enhance the gaming experience, it is imperative to use it responsibly and in compliance with the terms of service outlined by the game developers. I disclaim any responsibility for the misuse or unethical use of this bot.
